# MagicCarpet1001

This is the source code for **Magic Carpet 1001**, an unlicensed MegaSoft game from 1992.

This is one of the six games to appear on the famous **Caltron 6-in-1** cartridge, later relabeled **Myriad SIX IN ONE**.

However, what most people don't know is that this game was actually released on a cartridge of its own. This version never got to North America since it was printed on a 60-pin Famicom cartridge. 

What you are seeing here is probably the only copy of its source code... until now.

My objective is simple: since this is a simple game, people can use it to learn NES game programming.
